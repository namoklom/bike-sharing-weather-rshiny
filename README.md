An interactive web application built using **R Shiny** that forecasts hourly **bike-sharing demand** based on **weather conditions**. The app uses real-time weather data from the **OpenWeather API** and a regression model trained on historical Seoul bike-sharing data to make demand predictions for multiple global cities.

## 🌐 Project Overview

Urban mobility services like bike-sharing are heavily influenced by environmental conditions. This app helps city planners and service providers **visualize, interpret, and plan** for expected demand by combining real-time weather forecasting with machine learning.

The app supports **five cities**:
- 🗽 **New York, USA**
- 🗼 **Paris, France**
- 🏯 **Suzhou, China**
- 🎡 **London, UK**
- 🏙️ **Seoul, South Korea**

These cities were chosen for their similarity in bike-sharing fleet sizes and urban density to Seoul.

## 📷 Application Preview

Take a look at how the Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction App works in action:

The image above showcases the **"All Cities"** selection mode, where weather and demand data from multiple locations are visualized simultaneously.

This a focused view of **Suzhou** selected from the dropdown. The map zooms in on Suzhou with a pinpoint marker, providing localized data insights.

When **Seoul** is selected from the dropdown menu, the application provides detailed weather information and bike-sharing demand predictions for the city. The current weather in Seoul shows a temperature of 14.99°C, visibility of 10,000 meters, humidity at 90%, wind speed of 3.61 m/s, and the timestamp is 2025-05-23 18:00:00. The left panel features interactive plots, including a 5-day temperature trend showing recent temperature changes, a bike-sharing demand prediction trend forecasting upcoming demand, and a humidity versus demand plot to explore their relationship. This view helps users quickly understand how weather factors influence bike-sharing demand in Seoul.

## 🔍 Features & Functionality

### 1. **Global Forecast Map (Max Bike Demand)**
- A **Leaflet-based interactive map** that displays the **maximum predicted hourly demand** over the next 5 days for each city.
- Cities are represented by **colored circles**:
  - **Green**: Low demand
  - **Yellow**: Moderate demand
  - **Red**: High demand
- Hover tooltip: Shows city name and predicted max demand.

### 2. **City-Level Daily Forecast**
- Clicking on a city marker reveals:
  - A **bar chart** showing daily predicted demand over 5 days.
  - A **data table** of weather metrics (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation).
- Allows users to understand how weather variations affect demand.

### 3. **Predictive Model**
- Trained on **Seoul public bike-sharing dataset**.
- Features used for prediction:
  - Hour of the day
  - Day of the week
  - Weather conditions (temp, humidity, wind speed, clouds, etc.)
- The trained model is reused to predict bike demand in other cities using weather forecasts.
